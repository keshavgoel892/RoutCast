# 🚗 Route-Based Weather Forecasting App

## 🌤️ Introduction

Weather conditions significantly impact travel safety, efficiency, and decision-making in both personal and commercial transportation. While traditional weather apps provide location-specific data, they often fail to offer insights across a traveler’s entire route. Our application addresses this crucial gap by forecasting weather across an entire journey.

## 🧠 Problem Definition

- ❌ **Lack of Continuous Tracking**: Current systems only provide point-in-time weather data for specific locations.
- ❌ **Poor Integration**: Weather info is not seamlessly integrated with route planning tools.
- ❌ **Weak Visualization**: Users struggle to understand how conditions vary across different segments.
- ❌ **No Real-Time Updates**: Many apps don’t offer timely updates to adapt plans mid-route.

## ✅ Proposed Solution

- 🌐 **Route-Based Forecasting**: Combines weather data with route planning.
- 🎯 **Dynamic Weather Markers**: Uses custom SVG icons and color-coding for key route points.
- 📊 **Rich Visualization Tools**: Includes gradient displays, precipitation graphs, and parameter comparisons.
- 🔁 **Frequent Updates**: Delivers weather updates every 15 minutes for real-time awareness.
